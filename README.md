# Arkanoid-Controller-USB-Adapter

Adapter for the Famicom Arkanoid controller to USB.

Two modes are available, an absolute position mode that is good for Breakout under MAME, and a mouse emulation mode that is better for Arkanoid under MAME.

You need a decent USB port for this. If there is electrical noise it can cause the position to jump. I use a powered hub.
